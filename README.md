Check out my blog post to see the thought process behind this project: https://medium.com/@tdshah1/

All C# source code and Unity assets & environments for the final project are available at the link below. To start the experience, simply run the executable file. Please ensure you have Unity3D installed on your system and that you have access to a properly configured Oculus headset and XBOX controller.

We plan to make this project open source & "Github ready" soon!
